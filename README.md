### Hi, Luca here! ðŸ‘‹

## Presentation
I'm a Computer Science (BSc) student at Unicam (UniversitÃ  di Camerino) and I'm about to graduate.
I'm still looking for a specific field to deep-dive in but, in the meantime, I like working on all kinds of projects, especially those where UI/UX thinking is required.
<br>Feel free to take a look at my <a href="motsiiih.github.io" target="_blank">personal webpage</a>!

  <li>Java</li>
</ul>
